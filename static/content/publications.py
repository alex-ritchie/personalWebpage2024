        'abstract': '''We introduce the fair exposure problem in online platforms, studying how to balance 
                   content exposure between different user groups while maximizing engagement. Our work 
                   develops a theoretical framework for analyzing content propagation under homophily, 
                   proving that fairness-agnostic approaches lead to group-homogeneous targeting. We 
                   demonstrate that even with fairness constraints, optimal solutions may still target 
                   one group with limited content diversity.''',
