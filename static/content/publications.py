        'venue': 'AAAI 2023',
        'conference': 'The Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence',

        'year': 2023,
        'abstract': 'We introduce the fair exposure problem in online platforms, studying how to balance content exposure between different user groups while maximizing engagement. Our work develops a theoretical framework for analyzing content propagation under homophily, proving that fairness-agnostic approaches lead to group-homogeneous targeting. We demonstrate that even with fairness constraints, optimal solutions may still target one group with limited content diversity.',

        'abstract': 'Recent research has established sufficient conditions for finite mixture models to be identifiable from grouped observations, even allowing substantial overlap among components. This paper proposes an algorithm for consistently estimating any identifiable mixture model from grouped observations. The approach is based on an oracle inequality for weighted kernel density estimators and shows that consistent estimation of grouped distributions leads to consistent estimation of mixture components. The paper provides a practical algorithm for paired observations and demonstrates its effectiveness in outperforming existing methods, especially with significantly overlapping components.',

        'abstract': 'This paper introduces supervised density estimation, where samples from a target density are supplemented by auxiliary samples from a contrasting density that the model should avoid. It presents two methods to incorporate contrastive samples in density estimation and demonstrates improvement for tasks such as anomaly detection. The proposed approaches are theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and adaptable to models from Gaussian mixtures to variational autoencoders.',

        'abstract': 'This paper introduces a multiobjective approach to supervised PCA (SPCA) that jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and variance explained by the learned representation. It supports arbitrary loss functions and outperforms existing SPCA methods in both explained variance and predictive power, enabling extensions such as generalized linear models and kernel-based methods.',

        'abstract': 'This study explores the use of 3D printing to create functionally graded shape memory polymers (SMPs) with controlled shape recovery. By tailoring the thermal properties across different sections, these SMPs exhibit programmable shape changes in response to heat, achieving applications in biomedical and aerospace fields. The approach demonstrates enhanced control of recovery sequence via multimaterial SMP design.',
